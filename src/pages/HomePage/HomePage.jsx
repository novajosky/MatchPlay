      <h4>What is MatchPlay?</h4>
      <h7>Match play is an app that connects golfers of all types. Wether you are a beginner or a seasoned veteran, MatchPlay will allow you to play with like minded people.</h7> <br/>
      <h7>Playing golf as a single player is a crapshoot because you could get matched up with anyone with a much different skill set or mind set than your own which can result in a very poor experience for all parties.</h7><br/>
      <h7>Match Play will allow you to create your golf profile and help find you the right partners for your next gold adventure.</h7><br/>
